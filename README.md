# Fixium Graphic Maker (FGM)

**Fixium Graphic Maker (FGM)** is a powerful web-based tool designed to visualize and compare performance snapshots generated by the [Fixium](https://github.com/yourrepo/fixium) plugin for MCPE 0.15.10 servers. It transforms raw encoded snapshot data into interactive, easy-to-understand charts, enabling server admins and developers to monitor resource usage and server health effectively.
